      My name is ≈Åukasz. I'm easy going, friendly type, with passion for art, nature and science. For last ten years I was working
      in the tech crew in the Contemporary Theater of Wroclaw, my job was to build sets for the plays and work during performances, but I was also a sound engineer. I also create sounds myself, I write, play and sing in my band called UnAssigned. I'm very curious about the World and I'm trying to know as many aspects of its as I can, that's why I found astronomy, philosophy and science in general, great ways to understand more, but of course not everything can be read out of the book. Thats why I travel and meet people. During my work for the theater I managed to visit, and live in the places
      around the world, I've spent some time in Japan, Chile, Iceland, Thailand and western Europe. So that's a lil'bit about me.
